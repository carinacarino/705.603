# ML_Microservice_Example
This microservice serves as an example of leveraging machine learning to enhance decision-making in targeted advertising campaigns. It predicts whether an individual is a good candidate for advertising based on their age and salary. The prediction model is built on a **Random Forest** algorithm, trained using data from the 'Social_Network_Ads.csv' dataset.
